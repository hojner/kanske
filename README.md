# What is Kanske?

## The name

The name "kanske" is Swedish for maybe. Which, at the time of naming, was a
rough estimate of the probability that project would reach Prod status. The word
is also pretty similar to Kanshi, tha app I'm trying to rewrite.

## The fuctionality

Arch Wiki says this about Kanshi: \*"Kanshi allows you to define output profiles
that are automatically enabled and disabled on hotplug. For instance, this can
be used to turn a laptop's internal screen off when docked.

This is a Wayland equivalent for tools like autorandr. kanshi can be used on
Wayland compositors supporting the wlr-output-management protocol."\*

Kanske is meant to be a Rust re-write of Kanshi, let's see how close we get to
kanshi functionality in the end...

## The disclaimer

Look, I'm obviously no developer. No Rust developer and no C developer. This is
probably full of bugs and logic errors. Don't use it unless you feel ok with
that. And don't blame me when your PC is bricked.
